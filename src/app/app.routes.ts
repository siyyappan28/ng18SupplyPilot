// This is a simple routing module for an Angular application. It defines two routes:
// 1. The 'dashboard' route, which is protected by an authentication guard (authGuard). If the user is authenticated, it loads the DashboardComponent.
// 2. The root path ('') which loads the authentication routes from the auth.routes module. This is where the login component would be defined.
// The appRoutes array is used to configure the routing for the application, allowing for lazy loading of components and route protection.
// The authGuard is a function that checks if the user is authenticated before allowing access to the dashboard route. If not authenticated, it redirects the user to the login page.
// The loadChildren syntax is used for lazy loading, which helps in optimizing the application by loading modules only when needed.
// This approach improves the performance of the application by reducing the initial load time and allowing for better code organization.
// The appRoutes array is exported for use in the main application module, where it will be imported and used to configure the Angular Router.
// The routes are defined in a way that allows for easy expansion in the future, such as adding more protected routes or additional features.
// The use of lazy loading and route guards is a common practice in Angular applications to enhance security and performance.
// The appRoutes array is a key part of the application's routing configuration, enabling a modular and maintainable structure for handling navigation and access control within the app.
// The routes are defined in a way that allows for easy expansion in the future, such as adding more protected routes or additional features.
